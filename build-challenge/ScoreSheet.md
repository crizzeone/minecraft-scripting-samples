## Additional Bonuses

### Voting

The second place winner of the vote gets DOUBLE their score
The third place winner of the vote get a 50% bonus added to their score

### (Low) Activity

In an attempt to balance out team numbers and the number of hours that a team puts in, we award bonuses based on lower activity (collective time spent running around) for teams that haven't spent as much time in-game as other teams (for example, a team with one player will have lower activity, typically, vs. a team with four players):

* Teams that are the in the second most active group (as indicated by ▓) receive a 25% score bonus
* Teams that are the in the third most active group (as indicated by ▒) receive a 50% score bonus
* Teams that are the in the least active group (as indicated by ░) receive a double score bonus
* Teams that are the most active (as indicated by █) don't receive a bonus, beyond a virtual high five for their awesomeness
